# Thumbnail Generator

This is a project based on the Rocketseat Tutorial on Serverless Thumbnail Generation with Next.js. Here is the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvetoR6V5ic).

To generate a thumbnail, just call the /thumbnail.png endpoint with title (the thumbnail title) and bg (the background color param) query params and use that URL to your img tags.

## Params

**title** (obligatory): A string containing the title
**bg** (optional): A hex code containing the background color (default is #121214)

<!-- **logos** (optional): The tech logos svg link -->

## TODOs

- Add logo support
